<h1> (1) What is software ? </h1>
<h3> => Software: s/w is the language of computer.</h3>
<h3> => is a collection of computer programs and related data that provide the instructions for telling a computer what to do and how to do it.</h3>
<h3> => Just like human language.</h3>
<h3> => 3 main groups depending on their use and application.</h3>
<h3> (1) System software / operating system. </h3>
<h3> (2) Application s/w. </h3>
<h3> (3) Programming language.</h3> <br> <br> <br>

<h1> (2) types of software?</h1>
<h3> (1) System s/w or OS: </h3>
<h3> = provides the basic functions for computer usage and helps to run the computer hardware and system.</h3>
<h3> = is the s/w used by the computer to translate inputs from various sources into a language which a machine can understand.</h3>
<h3> = Basically OS coordinates the different hardware components of a computer.</h3>
<h3> = Ex. Linux, window, macOS, Android, iOS</h3> <br>
<h3> (2) Application s/w:</h3>
<h3> = is the general designation of computer programs for performing user tasks.</h3>
<h3> = Types of application s/w </h3>
<h3> - (1) Mobile app : Application that run on mobile  <br>
                        Ex. Instagram, facebook, etc  </h3>
<h3> - (2) Desktop app : That run stand-alone in a desktop or laptop computer.  <br>
                         Ex. Microsoft office suite which includes Word, Excel and PowerPoint.  <br>
                         Ex. Outlook for email, and firefox, Google Chrome, Mozilla are the web browser.  <br>
                         Anti-virus is an application and so is the media player.  </h3>
<h3> - (3) Web app: That run on a web browser  <br>
                         ex. google.com, facebook.com,etc  </h3>  <br>
<h3> (3) Programming s/w: </h3>
<h3> = is the process of designing, writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code of computer programs.</h3>
<h3> = This s/w is pawritten in a programming language. </h3>
<h3> = The purpose of programming is to create a program that exhibits a certain desired behavior. </h3>
<h3> =  Ex. c++, html, java, Simlab, php, Python and Visual basic. </h3> <br> <br> <br>

<h1> (3)  what is software methodology ? </h1>
<h3> =>  Software development methodology is a process or series of processes used in software development. Again, quite broad but that it is things like a design phase, a development phase. It is ways of thinking about things like waterfall being a non iterative kind of process. Generally it takes the form of defined phases.</h3> <br> <br> <br>

<h1> (4) what is design pattern ? </h1>
<h3> => A design pattern is the re-usable form of a solution to a design problem. The idea was introduced by the architect Christopher Alexander and has been adapted for various other disciplines, particularly softwareÂ engineering.</h3>
